The objective of this site is to distribute maps extracted from OpenStreetMap data to aid in Earthquake mapping. The data has been developed by thousands of crowd-sourced volunteers, and in our estimations provides the most up to date maps of Nepal.

Maps will soon be available for all 11 most affected districts, and updated as frequently as we can. The 11 most affected districts, where a state of emergency has been declared are: Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Dhading, Kavre, Nuwakot, Sindhupalchowk, Dolakha, Gorkha, Rasuwa, Ramecchap.

With prayers for efficient recovery, the Kathmandu Living Labs team.
